sACNView is a tool for viewing, monitoring and testing the ANSI/ESTA E1.17 protcol, informally known as "Streaming ACN".

This protcol is used in lighting systems (typically theatre, television, live entertainment and other systems where a high performance stream of data is required).

This is sACNView mark 2, which supplants the original version.
